# Learn80/20 📚✨  
**Your Learning Assistant using the Pareto Principle**

---

## 🚀 What Is This?
**Learn80/20** is my personal AI-powered learning assistant that uses the **Pareto Principle** (aka the 80/20 rule) to help you master **any topic** by focusing on the *20% of concepts* that give you *80% of the results*.  
It’s powered by OpenAI and sprinkled with a bit of my frustration from wasting time on things I didn’t need to know 😅

## 😅 Why I Built It
1. I’m currently learning **German 🇩🇪**, and Duolingo wasn’t cutting it.  
2. I needed a smarter way to cut through the noise and focus on what *actually* matters.  
3. I also wanted to showcase something cool to recruiters — yes, you — who are reading this and thinking: *"Did he really build this?"*  
   > Answer: **Yes. Yes I did.** 😎
